WELCOME!!!
- This is an application to convert the data in a TEXT file (.txt), into an XML file (.xml), following the accurate XML Format & Syntax.


//Steps to run this program. (Main Objective)
1. Initially, a randomly written text file can be found in the project -> predefined_data.txt
   View that text file to see the data if needed.
2. It can be used to be written in an XML format using the class -> TxtToXmlConverter.java
3. Open TxtToXmlConverter.java class and direct to line 74.
4. Change the name of the input text file as "predefined_data.txt", and then run the class. (Note: it is set to "predefined_data.txt" already)
5. The new xml file gets created, and will have the written data from text to xml in -> output.xml
6. Open the output.xml file to view the newly written XML data.


//Additional methods to use if wanted. (Additional text file creation methods upon user's interest)
- If the user wants to create a text file programmatically, then use the class -> TxtFileGenerator.java
- Edit the hardcoded data (not the keys, but the values) from line 16 to 19 accordingly.
- Then run the class.
- It then creates "written_data.txt" with the hardcoded data accordingly.

-- or...

- If the user wants to create a random text file with their own preferred data, then use the class -> TxtFileGeneratorWithUserInput.java
- Run the class.
- Give in the data prompted by the program in the run terminal.
- Once all the data are inserted by the user, the program then creates "written_data_user_input.txt" with the user input data accordingly.

-- then...
  
- Open -> TxtToXmlConverter.java
- Change the name of the input text file on line 74 accordingly.
- Run the program to get the XML file for the relevant text data.
- XML file named "output.xml" gets created with the relevant xml data.
- View output.xml for the output received.


THANK YOU.
